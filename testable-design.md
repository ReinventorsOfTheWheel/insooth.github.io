# Start with testable design right now

People tend to have _work done_ quickly. That is usually too fast for most. Even if that unit tests are prevalent in software development we produce bugs. How is that possible when we have so much opportunities to test?

# Possibilities

- runtime polymorphism, classic
- hi-perf dependency injection (cf. policy based design)
- linker magic
- variant driven (mid of policy-based design and runtime polymorphism)
- ?
 
What about the types, that are passed by value?
